**Check all Worker Queues** 

v1.0

This Worker runs a simple routine that will iterate through the message queue references of an application's Worker call-chain and return a list containing the number of elements in each Queue.

To use the Check all Worker Queues Worker:

1️⃣ Load it dynamically from another Worker using its Public API.

2️⃣ Use its Public API to return a list of Workers and the number of elements in their queues, and/or...

3️⃣ ...view its front panel via the Debug Server’s Application Manager while running.
